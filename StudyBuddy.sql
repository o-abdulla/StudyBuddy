--('Explain component based archetecture.', 'Component-Based Architecture is a design paradigm where an application is broken down into modular, reusable, and independent components. Each component encapsulates a specific piece of functionality, and these components are then composed to build the entire application. This architectural style promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability.'),
--('How do you authenticate to your THIRD PARTY API?', 'Authentication with a third-party API typically involves obtaining an access token or API key from the service provider and including that token or key in your HTTP requests. The exact process depends on the authentication mechanism used by the third-party API.'),
--('How do you parse the data that you get from your THIRD PARTY API? What kind of data are you getting back from the API?', 'Parsing data from a third-party API involves extracting relevant information from the response received after making a request to the API.

It is a field (or a set of fields) in a database table that refers to the primary key in another table. This relationship between tables is fundamental to maintaining referential integrity in a relational database.');
